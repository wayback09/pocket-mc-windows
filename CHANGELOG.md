# Changelog

This file summarizes the Pocket MC Desktop release line from `v1.0.0` to `v1.6.5`.

## v1.6.5 - Cross-Play & PocketMine Player Management Fixes

This patch release resolves critical player management issues for cross-play (Floodgate) and PocketMine environments, ensuring that bans and operator commands work reliably across all player types.

### 🛠️ Fixes & Enhancements
* **Cross-Play Ban & Op Reliability**: Fixed an issue where Java Edition servers would fail to ban or op Bedrock players connected via Floodgate. PocketMC now correctly formats player names without quotes for Java servers, preventing "Player does not exist" errors when interacting with Bedrock players (e.g., `.PlayerName`).
* **PocketMine Ban Parsing**: Fixed a bug where PocketMine's `banned-players.txt` was not being read correctly due to its pipe-delimited format. The player list UI now accurately displays banned PocketMine players and allows for successful unbanning.

## v1.6.4 - Player Management, Console Intelligence & Bedrock Profiles

This release introduces a new player management suite, intelligent console log filtering, and engine-aware settings profiles to provide native configuration options for Bedrock servers.

### ✨ New Features
* **Player Management Suite**: Introduced a comprehensive player management UI powered by a new state file service. Administrators can now natively view and manage operators, banned players, banned IPs, and whitelists directly from the UI without editing JSON files.
* **Console Log Intelligence**: Added a new log classification engine to intelligently parse, classify, and filter server console logs by severity and origin, reducing log spam and improving readability.
* **Engine-Aware Settings Profiles**: Re-architected the settings backend with a new profiling system. The application now provides engine-specific UI configurations and dropdowns (e.g., Gamemodes, Level Types) tailored to the active server's engine.
* **Native Bedrock Settings**: Added a dedicated Bedrock settings view exposing Bedrock-exclusive properties including `server-portv6`, `allow-cheats`, `texturepack-required`, `force-gamemode`, `default-player-permission-level`, and `tick-distance`.

### 🛠️ Fixes & Enhancements
* **Dynamic World Backups**: Refactored the backup service to parse server properties files dynamically. Backups now correctly identify and target the active world folder name for Bedrock and Pocketmine instead of assuming the default `world/` directory.
* **CI Changelog Extraction**: Updated the production build GitHub workflow to improve release note extraction algorithms during automated deployments.
* **Settings Cleanup**: Removed legacy tunnel limit dialog classes and cleaned up redundant dependencies across multiple settings panels.

## v1.6.3 - Installation Lifecycle & UI Safety

This release brings major stability enhancements to the server installation process, introducing download cancellation, safety locks, and better real-time status tracking across the application.

### 🔒 Safety & Installation Control
* **Download Cancellation**: You can now safely cancel server software downloads mid-way. Doing so instantly cleans up all partially downloaded files and deletes the pending server folder automatically.
* **Navigation Lock & Prompts**: The application now intelligently locks sidebar navigation while a server is downloading. Attempting to close PocketMC during an active download will now trigger a safety confirmation dialog.
* **Explicit Installing State**: Introduced a dedicated `Installing` status. This provides accurate visual feedback when servers are processing installers (like Forge/Fabric) and allows you to halt the installation if it hangs.

### 📈 Performance & Networking
* **Console Anti-Freeze**: Added advanced output throttling and a defensive buffer drain to the server console. This completely prevents UI freezes and memory crashes when high-volume installer logs or spam errors flood the terminal.
* **Live Tunnel Updates**: The tunnel management UI has been rebuilt to support real-time state tracking without visual flickering. Tunnels waiting for a public address are now continuously polled in the background.
* **Wizard Redirection**: Fixed the dashboard connection flow to properly redirect first-time users straight to the Playit setup wizard.

### 🛠️ Ecosystem Enhancements & Fixes
* **Java Download Dialog**: Added a dedicated visual progress dialog when downloading missing Java runtimes, keeping you informed rather than freezing the background.
* **Dynamic Bedrock Backups**: The backup engine now dynamically reads your Bedrock server's configuration to locate the exact world folder name, ensuring your backups never miss their target.
* **Floodgate Fixes**: Fixed an issue where Floodgate (cross-play addon) failed to install on Paper and Spigot servers by routing the download directly through the GeyserMC official API.
* **UI Polish**: Tightened the Tunnel Page layout by disabling unnecessary scrollbars.

## v1.6.2 - LAN Connectivity & Resilient Tunneling

This release introduces LAN IP visibility to the dashboard for easier local play and overhauls the Playit.gg tunnel creation logic to be more resilient and informative.

### 🏠 LAN Connectivity
* **Dashboard LAN IP Display**: You can now view your server's Local Area Network (LAN) IP and port directly on the instance cards. This makes it easier to connect from other devices on the same network without needing a public tunnel.
* **One-Click Copy**: Added a dedicated copy button for LAN addresses, mirroring the functionality for public tunnel addresses.
* **Port Persistence**: Improved internal metadata tracking to ensure server ports are accurately cached and displayed even when the server is offline.

### 🌐 Resilient Playit.gg Integration
* **API-Driven Limit Handling**: Moved away from hardcoded tunnel limits. PocketMC now communicates directly with the Playit API to determine if you've reached your tunnel quota, providing real-time feedback.
* **Actionable Error Messaging**: If a tunnel cannot be created due to account limits, the application now displays a clear, actionable message with a direct link to upgrade or manage your tunnels, rather than a generic failure.
* **Persistent Creation Dialog**: The manual "Create Tunnel" dialog now remains open if a creation attempt fails, allowing you to fix configuration issues or view error details without losing your progress.
* **Non-Blocking Auto-Provisioning**: Failures during automatic tunnel creation (at server startup) are now handled as non-blocking notifications. Your server will still start, and you'll be notified of the connectivity issue to resolve it later.

### 🛠️ Internal Improvements
* **Metadata Reliability**: Refactored `InstanceMetadata` to better track primary networking ports across different server engines.
* **Standardized Failure Paths**: Unified error handling between manual tunnel creation and automatic background provisioning for a more consistent user experience.

## v1.6.1 - Cross-Play & UI Tweaks

This is a minor patch release focusing on fixing cross-play port configuration and polishing the dashboard UI for Bedrock servers.

### ✨ Enhancements & Fixes
* **Geyser Config Port Patching**: Fixed an issue where the Geyser config port was not being properly patched on startup for non-Spigot loaders (Fabric, Forge, NeoForge). The patching engine now correctly searches the `config/` directory.
* **Bedrock IP Copy Behavior**: Fixed a bug where clicking the "Copy" button next to a cross-play server's Bedrock Hostname incorrectly copied the numeric IP address instead of the hostname.
* **Dedicated Bedrock UI Icons**: Updated the Dashboard UI to display the correct native Bedrock icon (Cube) instead of the default Desktop icon for dedicated Bedrock instances, ensuring visual consistency across all Bedrock connection types.

## v1.6.0 - Dynamic Theming & Advanced Tunnel Management

### 🎨 Dynamic Theming & UI Enhancements
* **User-Selectable Themes**: Added a new application theme toggle in App Settings allowing you to freely switch between Light, Dark, and System Default themes without needing to restart the application.
* **Intelligent Color Adaptability**: Overhauled dashboard and tunnel interfaces to use dynamic resources, ensuring high readability and vibrant aesthetics regardless of the active theme.

### 🌐 Advanced Playit.gg Tunnel Management
* **Automated Provisioning**: Eliminated the manual tunnel guide. Tunnels are now seamlessly and automatically provisioned in the background the moment you start your server.
* **Full Tunnel Controls**: The Tunnel Page has been upgraded with a comprehensive management suite. You can now rename tunnels, change local ports, toggle them on/off, and delete them directly from the PocketMC UI.
* **Explicit Editing States**: Refactored the tunnel renaming and port editing fields to require explicit "Save" actions, preventing accidental misconfigurations.
* **Connection Transparency**: Added dynamic skeleton loading indicators and clearer error states to the Dashboard's instance cards, providing immediate visual feedback while tunnel addresses are being resolved or if they hit rate limits.

## v1.5.4 - Playit.gg Connection Gate & Settings Refactor

### 🚀 Playit.gg Connectivity Gate
* **Pre-Start Warning Dialog**: Added a non-blocking `PreStartAgentWarningWindow` that intercepts server startups if the Playit.gg agent is disconnected or pending setup, guiding users to resolve the issue before launching.
* **Centralized State Management**: Integrated `AgentProvisioningService` to act as the single source of truth for tunnel states globally across the application.
* **Smart State Handling**: Accurately categorizes pending states like `AwaitingSetupCode` to trigger the warning gate, providing a smoother connection setup flow.

### 🛠️ UI & Settings Refactor
* **Removed Legacy Software Updates**: Removed the redundant "Software Updates" expander from the Server Settings page, cleaning up the UI and relying on the application's core update mechanisms.

### 🧪 Test Coverage Improvements
* **Network Reliability**: Introduced `PortReliabilityTestWorkspace` helper class to facilitate robust network-related component testing.
* **JVM & File Handling Tests**: Added comprehensive unit tests for `ServerLaunchConfigurator` to verify version-specific JVM arguments and proper file management during server startup.

## v1.5.3 - Java Management, Networking & Setup Fixes

### 🔒 Playit.gg Security & UX Hardening
* **New Guided Setup Wizard**: Replaced the manual setup flow with a 4-step guided wizard that simplifies agent linking and removes the need for users to manually manage secret keys.
* **UI Cleanup**: Removed legacy fields for "Secret Key" and "Provisioning Backend" to provide a cleaner, more secure dashboard experience.

### ☕ Java Runtime Lifecycle Management
* **User Intent Persistence**: Added a "User Removed" flag to the app configuration. Manually deleted runtimes will no longer be automatically re-downloaded at startup, respecting your decision to save disk space.
* **Active Instance Protection**: The system now blocks the deletion of any Java runtime that is currently being used by a running server instance to prevent unexpected crashes.
* **Individual Restore Controls**: Added a "Download" button to each missing runtime row. You can now restore specific Java versions individually without being forced to download all missing bundled runtimes.
* **Atomic Deletion Logic**: Implemented safe-guarding logic that ensures your intent flag is only saved if the deletion is successful, with automatic rollback on file-system errors.

### 🌐 Networking & Port Resolution
* **Dynamic Port Reservation**: Fixed a bug where offline servers would permanently block ports. Ports are now dynamically released when an instance is stopped, allowing other servers to use them.
* **Improved Error Messaging**: Updated port conflict dialogs to be more actionable. The app now specifically identifies when an external process is holding a port and provides clearer guidance on how to resolve the conflict.

### 🛠️ Internal Improvements
* **Settings Architecture**: Expanded `AppSettings` to support complex state tracking for managed runtimes.
* **Provisioning Flow**: Refined `JavaProvisioningService` to distinguish between background maintenance and manual user-triggered repairs.

## v1.5.2 - Intelligence Safeguards & Under-the-Hood Fixes

This release introduces safety guardrails for the AI summarization feature to protect against unexpected token costs, fixes native Bedrock port conflicts, and removes console command suggestions for a cleaner, faster experience.

### ✨ Enhancements & Fixes

- **AI Token Safeguards:** Added a size threshold check for server session logs. Generating an AI summary for extremely large sessions (>1.5MB of logs) will now prompt a warning dialog to prevent accidental token over-consumption.
- **Enhanced AI Prompt:** The backend summarization prompt has been fully overhauled to instruct the model to ignore Personally Identifiable Information (PII) like IPs and emails, and to focus more heavily on performance metrics and configuration issues.
- **Bedrock Port Conflict Fix:** IPv6 ports (`server-portv6`) are now automatically bound and assigned based on the selected IPv4 port (`server-port + 1`) when editing Server Settings. This resolves the `ipv6 port conflict` crashes entirely when running multiple native instances on the same host.
- **Console Streamlining**: Slashed out the bulky command suggestion overlay from the server console. This provides a cleaner UI, stops accidental command misfires, and prevents the application from constantly parsing massive log text streams for new command syntaxes.

## v1.5.0 - Modloader Expansion, Marketplace Intelligence & Instance Management

This release adds NeoForge as a supported modloader, introduces engine-aware addon management with full dependency resolution in the marketplace, and ships a suite of instance management improvements including renaming, customization, and minimum version filtering. Loader-aware filtering for Modrinth and CurseForge is now fully enforced, and several false-warning and fallback bugs are resolved.

### 🧩 Modloader Expansion

- **NeoForge Support:** NeoForge is now a fully supported modloader option in the instance creation workflow, joining Fabric and Forge.
- **Loader-Aware Filtering:** Modrinth and CurseForge search results are now filtered by the active loader (Fabric / Forge / NeoForge) to prevent incompatible addon installs (#17).
- **Modrinth Fallback Hardening:** The Modrinth relaxed query no longer falls back to an arbitrary loader. When a version is not found, a clear message is returned instead of a misleading result (#18).

### 🛒 Marketplace Intelligence

- **EngineCompatibility Model:** Introduced a new `EngineCompatibility` model so addons in the marketplace are resolved and displayed based on the active server engine.
- **Dependency Resolution:** The marketplace now automatically resolves addon dependencies and manages addon manifests, reducing manual setup for complex modpacks.
- **False Warning Reduction:** Eliminated spurious incompatible-loader warnings that appeared during addon install even when the loader was valid.

### 📁 Instance Management

- **Instance Renaming:** Instances can now be renamed directly from the UI, with collision detection and case-safe directory moves to prevent filesystem conflicts.
- **Name & Description Customization:** Added support for editing instance names and descriptions from within the instance settings panel.
- **Minimum Version Filtering:** Server providers now respect minimum version constraints during instance creation, with testability improvements to the underlying filtering logic.

### ✨ Dashboard & UI Polish

- **Engine-Aware Settings:** The Addons tab now dynamically filters content. Java-only sections (like Modrinth/Forge) are hidden when managing Bedrock or PocketMine instances.
- **IP Duplicate Suppression:** The dashboard card now intelligently hides the secondary "Bedrock IP" row for native Bedrock servers to reduce clutter.
- **Dashboard Grid Layout:** Modernized the instance card layout with improved metrics scannability and connection clarity.

## v1.3.0 - Architectural Hardening & Observability

This release focuses entirely on massive under-the-hood structural improvements designed to make PocketMC safer, significantly more resilient to failures, and vastly easier to debug. Known internally as "Phase 1 & 2 of the Architecture Audit," this brings PocketMC from a prototype state into production-ready territory!

### 🛡️ Security & Integrity Engine (Phase 1)

- **Artifact Verification:** Implemented deep SHA1/SHA256 signature verification directly into the `DownloaderService`. Any Playit daemon or Paper/Vanilla jar you pull from external networks is now heavily hashed to detect silent corruption or man-in-the-middle tammpering.
- **Graceful Lifecycle System:** Hardened the exit behaviors! Instead of blindly closing and triggering unrecorded player kicks, exiting the app now yields a custom 15-second `IApplicationLifecycleService.GracefulShutdownAsync()` loop that saves worlds and closes network tunnels correctly before quitting.
- **PII Scrubbing:** Heavily extended the `LogSanitizer`. PocketMC will now procedurally scrub personal metadata (like IPv4 strings and emails) from console captures using advanced RegEx pipelines before your crash logs ever touch an AI summary model.
- **RCON Client Engine:** StandardInput has been officially deprecated for interacting with Java child processes. PocketMC has fully migrated to a robust managed `RconClient` handling `try/catch` and direct socket control to eliminate standard I/O synchronization deadlocks on high server loads.

### 🔭 Diagnostic & Recovery Engine (Phase 2)

- **External Dependency Orchestrator:** Added a dynamic background thread loop (`DependencyHealthMonitor`) that constantly polls external microservices. Your settings page now features a **live dashboard** monitoring native latency status against **Adoptium**, **Playit.gg**, and **Modrinth**. You'll instantly know if a server failure is on your end or theirs.
- **Disaster Recovery (Off-site Replications):** Significantly expanded the local automated snapshot tool. You can now configure an external sync directory (e.g., Google Drive/Dropbox sync folder) inside your Settings menu. Upon completing a local ZIP backup, PocketMC will autonomously replicate that payload identically to your secondary disk.
- **"One-Click" Support Bundles:** Implemented an asynchronous `DiagnosticReportingService`. With a single click inside Settings, PocketMC packages your system specs, Java variables, global app logs, masked properties, and native crash-reports into one dense support ZIP on your desktop—completely wiping all clear-text passwords (like `rcon.password`) out of the bundle before it drops!
- **UI Modernization Refactors:** Abstracted away huge layers of tech-debt by decoupling the `ResourceMonitorService` and abstracting logic into `IAssetProvider`, eliminating major background memory leaks.

### 🔧 Internal Refactors

- Rebuilt architecture directory hierarchies shifting away from clustered `Providers` into a clean modular format (`Features/Instances`).
- Added graceful fallbacks to the new Update Engine banner checking systems.
- Handled UI context cleanup for settings panels and fixed missing null validation reference warnings.
