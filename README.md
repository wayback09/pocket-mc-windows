PocketMC is a native WPF/.NET 8 desktop app for local Minecraft server hosting; software downloads, isolated instances, app-managed Java/PHP runtimes, startup/shutdown, live metrics, logs, players, backups, cloud replication, add-ons, and Playit.gg tunnels, all in one polished Windows UI.

Your servers live on your machine, in the app root you choose. PocketMC is not a cloud host, not a Minecraft client launcher, and not a Linux web panel in a Windows costume.

<br>

## What changed without PocketMC vs. with it

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Hunt the right JAR. Guess the Java version. Edit configs by hand. | Server software and runtimes managed entirely by the app. |
| Scattered terminal scripts and folders across the disk. | Isolated instances under one root — clean, auditable, portable. |
| Manual Playit tunnel setup on every machine. | Built-in agent provisioning, tunnel creation, and live status. |
| Backups when someone remembers to run a script. | Manual, scheduled, external-folder, and cloud backup flows. |
| Replacing server files and hoping the update holds. | Staged updates with planning, snapshots, journals, and rollback. |
| Staring at raw logs until something makes sense. | Persistent history, diagnostics, and optional AI session summaries. |

## Features

<details open>
<summary><b>🖥️ &nbsp;Instance lifecycle</b></summary>
<br>

- Create isolated instances from the UI: server type, version, loader, seed, world type, gamemode, difficulty, player limit, EULA, custom world import.
- Start, stop, restart, and hard-kill servers from the dashboard or tray.
- Graceful shutdown via RCON with a console-input fallback.
- Crash detection with sanitized output capture and optional auto-restart with backoff.
- Per-instance port conflict checks before launch.
- Geyser-enabled instances patch Bedrock listener ports before starting.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>☕ &nbsp;Managed runtimes — zero Java headaches</b></summary>
<br>

- App-local Java provisioning through Adoptium: **Java 8, 11, 17, 21, and 25**.
- Java 25 downloaded by default in the background. Older versions pulled only when a selected Minecraft version requires them.
- Custom Java path override for advanced users.
- PocketMine-MP uses an app-managed PHP 8.2 PM5 runtime — nothing to install globally.
- All downloads use retries, partial-file cleanup, safe promotion, and hash verification where upstream hashes exist.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>📊 &nbsp;Dashboard, metrics, and console</b></summary>
<br>

- Live CPU / RAM / player metrics for running instances.
- Dynamic Geyser/Floodgate and Simple Voice Chat badges.
- Console output is buffered, sanitized, classified, and persisted across sessions.
- Stopped or crashed servers can still open a read-only last-session log view.
- Large logs are tailed — no loading a 500 MB log file into the UI.
- Console tools: filter, search, command input, session history.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🌐 &nbsp;Public access via Playit.gg</b></summary>
<br>

- Built-in Playit agent provisioning and setup flow.
- Automatic tunnel discovery for matching instance ports.
- Auto-creates tunnels for Java, Bedrock, Geyser, PocketMine, and Simple Voice Chat when possible.
- Interactive Ports Map with local ports, public addresses, roles, and live tunnel status.
- Clear states for offline agents, invalid tokens, unclaimed agents, pending allocations, and account limits.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🧩 &nbsp;Mods, plugins, packs, and add-ons</b></summary>
<br>

- Modrinth browser for server-side mods, plugins, and modpacks.
- CurseForge browser via your own API key.
- Poggit integration for PocketMine plugins.
- Dependency resolution where provider metadata supports it.
- Java metadata scanning: Fabric, Quilt, Forge, NeoForge, Bukkit/Paper plugin metadata, icons.
- Add-on inventory: display names, versions, loader types, side-support labels, warnings, update status.
- Enable/disable add-ons without manually renaming files.
- Bedrock `.mcpack`, `.mcaddon`, `.zip` ingestion with manifest parsing and automatic pack registration.
- Marketplace installs validate staged files, extensions, filenames, hashes, dependency failures, and unsafe modpack overrides.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>💾 &nbsp;Backups, cloud replication, and safe restore</b></summary>
<br>

- Manual and scheduled backups with retention pruning.
- Live-server backup: RCON save sync first, console save-command fallback.
- Locked and unsafe files (e.g. `session.lock`) skipped gracefully.
- Manifest entries include metadata, size deltas, checksums, and failure state.
- Cloud upload to **Google Drive**, **Dropbox**, and **OneDrive** with upload history and retention handling.
- Per-instance custom local and external-folder backup directories.
- Restore: checks ZIP integrity, validates checksums, extracts to staging, verifies world structure, backs up the current world, rolls back if apply fails.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>👥 &nbsp;Player and server controls</b></summary>
<br>

- Online player parsing for Java, Bedrock, and PocketMine log formats.
- Ban, op, whitelist, and runtime command actions from the player management page.
- Whitelist support for `whitelist.json` (Java), `allowlist.json` (BDS), and `white-list.txt` (PocketMine).
- Runtime setting application path for safer config changes while a server is running.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🔄 &nbsp;Instance version updates</b></summary>
<br>

- Offline update workflow with target version selection and Java runtime requirement checks.
- Compatibility warnings for tracked marketplace add-ons.
- Staged artifact replacement with supported add-on migration.
- Pre-update snapshots, journals, and locks for safe application.
- Rollback when an update fails mid-apply.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🖱️ &nbsp;Remote Control Dashboard</b></summary>
<br>

- Browser-based dashboard for managing servers from any device.
- Start, stop, restart, view the live console, send commands, and manage players remotely.
- Secure internet exposure via built-in **Cloudflare Quick Tunnels** or **Playit.gg HTTPS tunnels**, or restrict to LAN only.
- Configurable host port and per-feature access controls to prevent unauthorized actions.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🤖 &nbsp;AI session summaries</b></summary>
<br>

Generates structured session summaries from server logs using your own API key or a local endpoint.

Supported providers: **Google Gemini**, **OpenAI**, **Anthropic Claude**, **Mistral AI**, **Groq**, **Ollama / compatible local endpoint**

Logs are preprocessed and sanitized (IPs, emails) before being sent. You own the API key and the provider choice.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🪟 &nbsp;Windows integration and app polish</b></summary>
<br>

- Toast notifications, tray integration, minimize-to-tray, and start-with-Windows.
- Start minimized to tray on launch option.

<br>

## Quick start

```
1.  Pick an app root folder      →  Stores instances, runtimes, backups, logs, and settings.
2.  Create an instance           →  Family, version, world settings, player limit, EULA.
3.  Start the server             →  Connect via localhost or LAN IP.
4.  (Optional) Add public access →  Link Playit.gg — PocketMC resolves or creates tunnels.
5.  (Optional) Install content   →  Modrinth, CurseForge, Poggit, or Bedrock add-on import.
6.  (Optional) Protect the world →  Manual / scheduled / external / cloud backups.
7.  (Optional) Diagnose          →  Diagnostics, persistent logs, AI summaries.
```
