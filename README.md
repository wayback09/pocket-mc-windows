## What PocketMC is NOT

- Not a hosting service — runs locally on your PC
- Not a Linux server panel — no Docker, no SSH, no sysadmin skills needed
- Not a Minecraft launcher — it manages servers, not the game
- Not a script pack — replaces manual setup entirely


---


## What it does

PocketMC is a Windows desktop app for creating and managing Minecraft server instances — Java and Bedrock — without touching a command line. Java is bundled automatically. Public sharing is one click via Playit.gg. Without dealing with Java installs, port forwarding, or command-line setup.

Supported server types: **Vanilla · Paper · Fabric · Forge · Bedrock (BDS) · PocketMine-MP**

---

## Features

### 🎮 Server Management

- **Multi-Protocol Support** — Run Minecraft Java, native Bedrock Edition (BDS), and PocketMine-MP instances side-by-side. Includes one-click installation for 45+ Bedrock versions via community manifests.
- **Managed Runtimes** — PocketMC automatically provisions isolated JRE and PHP 8.x runtimes. Nothing touches your system Java/PHP installation.
- **Add-on & Plugin Browser** — Native support for Bedrock `.mcpack`/`.mcaddon` and Poggit (PocketMine) integration. Browse and install Java plugins from Modrinth/CurseForge. *Note: Poggit plugins currently do not support automatic dependency resolution due to upstream API limitations.*
- **Public Tunneling** — Integrated Playit.gg with guided setup. Public addresses are shown as copyable links on the dashboard.
- **Instance Isolation** — Each server runs in its own folder with independent configs, runtimes, and world files.

### 🔭 Observability & Intel

- **Live Metrics** — Real-time CPU, RAM, and player count tracking per instance.
- **Dependency Health Dashboard** — Live status monitoring for Adoptium, Playit.gg, and Modrinth microservices directly in the settings.
- **Modern AI Console** — Colorized logs with multi-keyword search, Regex filtering, command history, intelligent command auto-suggestions and crashes and errors AI analysis.
- **AI Session Summaries** — Generate structured summaries of your server sessions using Google Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Mistral AI, or Groq.
- **Disaster Recovery** — Automated backups with optional off-site replication to Google Drive/Dropbox sync directories and one-click support bundle export.

### 🛡️ Technical Excellence

- **RCON Client Engine** — Standard I/O is deprecated in favor of a robust managed RCON client, eliminating synchronization deadlocks on high-load servers.
- **Artifact Integrity** — Deep SHA1/SHA256 verification for all downloads (Playit daemon, server binaries) ensures your local files are never corrupted or tampered with.
- **Graceful Lifecycle** — A custom 15-second shutdown loop ensures all players are kicked and worlds are saved correctly before the app exits.
- **PII Scrubbing** — Automated RegEx pipelines scrub personal data (IPv4, emails) from console logs before they are processed by AI or exported.
- **UWP Loopback Automation** — One-click "Fix Bedrock LAN" tool to handle UWP network isolation, allowing local connections to Bedrock servers.

## Installation

Download `Setup.exe` from the [latest release](https://github.com/PocketMC/pocket-mc-windows/releases/latest) and run it.

- No admin rights required — installs per-user.
- .NET 8 Desktop Runtime is prompted automatically if missing.
- Java does **not** need to be pre-installed. PocketMC manages its own JRE stack.
- Updates are handled automatically via Velopack.

---

## Quick Start

**1. Pick a root folder** on first launch. Everything — servers, runtimes, tunnel — lives here.

**2. Create an instance.** Hit **New Instance**, choose a server type and version, accept the EULA, click **Create & Download**. The JAR fetches automatically.

**3. Start your server.** Hit **Start**. Metrics go live. Connect from Minecraft at `localhost` or your LAN IP.

**Optional: Enable public access.** Open the instance, enable Playit.gg tunneling, and follow the one-time account link flow. Your public address appears on the dashboard.

---
* ✔ Fully isolated — Java and PHP are managed internally
* ✔ No system setup — no environment variables, no conflicts
* ✔ Runs multiple servers safely side-by-side
